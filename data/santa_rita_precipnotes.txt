File: precip.xls


The file contains monthly precipitation measurements collected from 75 gauges at the Santa Rita Experimental Range. Of these 75 gauges, 24 are currently being monitored and 51 have been discontinued.

Some gauges had measurements recorded under more than one name, but all data are entered under the most recent name.

Precipitation amounts are recorded in 100ths of inches; two decimal places are assumed (e.g., 125 = 1.25 inches). A zero indicates that no precipitation occurred that month. A value of -9999 indicates missing or unavailable data.

The sources of file data were original handwritten records and previously digitized data. In cases of discrepancy the original records were considered to be the ultimate authority.
