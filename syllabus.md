#### **Course description**

The traditional goal of ecology has been to understand nature. Ecologists have made progress identifying the processes that generate global patterns of biodiversity and productivity, and this understanding provides a foundation for natural resource management. But we have now entered an era of rapid global change defined by increasing temperature, global nitrogen and phosphorous pollution, and biological invasions. Understanding nature is no longer sufficient; to manage natural resources and conserve biodiversity, we must also predict the impacts of global change. However, research to predict nature is a different enterprise than research to understand nature. Despite urging from leaders, our discipline has yet to fully tackle the challenge, and we have limited capacity to make skillful ecological forecasts. Some barriers are cultural: we still ask questions and design experiments focused more on understanding mechanism than on translating process-level understanding into predictive models. Some barriers are technological: ecological forecasting requires more sophisticated computational and statistical skills than traditional research. The key to overcoming both types of barriers is training. The goal of this class is to provide students a basic understanding of how populations, communities, and ecosystems change through time and to introduce fundamental concepts of how to forecast those changes. 

#### **Course Objectives**

The goal of this class is to provide students a basic understanding of how populations, communities, and ecosystems change through time and to provide fundamental concepts of how to forecast those changes. By the end of the course, students will:

1.	Have an appreciation of the dynamics of species, communities and ecosystem processes and the models used to represent those dynamics.

2.	Understand the basic concepts of forecasting that apply across fields along with the particular challenges within ecology.

3.	Have the quantitative skills to fit a statistical model to a training data set and then generate predictions, and accompanying uncertainty estimates, for a test data set.

#### **Methodology**

This course will be a mixture of lecture (20%), discussion of primary literature (10%) and hands-on experience working with data and models (70%). Discussion readings will be assigned and made available well in advance of the course. Instructors will provide data sets for the computer labs, though students will have the option of replacing some of these exercises with an independent project using their own data. Computer labs will use the [R statistical computing environment](https://cran.r-project.org/). 

#### **Language**

Witten materials will be in both English and Spanish. Lectures and discussions will be conducted primarily in Spanish, with some English.

#### **Course Materials**

1. The free online text book [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp) 
    will be used for some class activities, but is not required

2.  Also recommended is Mike Dietze's excellent textbook [Ecological Forecasting](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11048.html). 

3.	All reading materials will be made available through email.

4.	Laptops are required on all days.

#### **Assessment and grading**

10% of each student's grade will be based on class participation, 20% on daily quizes, and 70% written assignments (mostly computer labs to be completed during class time). 

#### **Contact hours**

The course will be delivered over 5 days, 8 hours per day (40 total hours). 20% of those hours will be devoted to lectures, 10% to discussion of primary literature, and 70% to quantitative exercises.
