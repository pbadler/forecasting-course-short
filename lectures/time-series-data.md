### Thinking about ecological data available for forecasting

* Ask group to brain storm types of data suitable for ecological forecasting
* Talk about each type as it is brought up
* Give or ask for examples of each data type as it is brought up
* Write them down on the board in a horizontal line from "further back in
  time/easier" to "more recent/more difficult"
  
`Resurvey -> Idiosyncratic -> Continuous w/Gaps -> Continuous`

* Ask what types of data are easier/harder to collect
* Ask what types are more common for going further back in time vs. more recent
* Draw these gradients on board

* How common are the different types?
* How long do you think most ecological studies/time-series are?
