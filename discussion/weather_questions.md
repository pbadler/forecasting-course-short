Note from Peter: If you find this difficult reading, you are not alone! The jargon was 
unfamiliar to me too. Save time by skipping the last section ("The future is bright").

### Predictive skill  ###

* What is predictive skill? What are the three main reasons it has improved so much throughout the history of weather forecasting? 

* What is an ensemble approach and how does it deal with uncertainty to make weather forecasts better? 

### Scale ###

* How do spatial and temporal scale relate to the concepts of resolved and unresolved scales in terms of weather forecasting? 

* What are some sources of predictability and unpredictability in weather forecasting? At what scales do they operate and how do errors in determining each of these affect predictions across scale?

### Comparison to ecology ###

* What is a fundamental advantage of meteorological forecasting compared to other scientific
disciplines?

* Does ecology have any advantages?
