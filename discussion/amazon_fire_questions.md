* Are these forecasts/predictions discussed in this model more like the forecasting discussed in the Clark paper from last week, or Houlahan? Why is one approach more appropriate for this model's purpose than the other?

* What might be the connections between ocean surface temperature and fire probability?  Are any of these model parameters slow variables? 

* How are the models evaluated? Are they compared to in or out of sample data? Or to some sort of null model? What are the strengths/weaknesses of evaluating the model this way?
